(** Main entry point for our Hello World application.

    This is a module interface file (.mli). It describes what the module
    exposes to the outside world. In this case, our main module doesn't
    expose any values or functions, as it's the executable entry point.

    Its purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the Hello module. *)

(* This file is intentionally left empty because executables typically
   don't expose any interfaces. All the functionality is in the .ml file. *)
